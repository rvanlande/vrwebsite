about.title = About me
about.content = \
My name is Renaud, i'm a software developer and JAVA/JEE architect. \
Passion ? code, design, new technologies. \
Goal ? BUILD quality applications ! \
I currently work for Active3D company which is building a facility management web platform. \
Technologies used to build this website are HTML5/CSS/MDL/Sass/RiotJS/Javascript for the front-end and Vert.x/Java/ElasticSearch the back-end. \
This is not the most effective way to build a presentation website \
but it allows me to test these technologies and validate a simple (no cumbersome framework), effective and scalable web stack for more significant project.
